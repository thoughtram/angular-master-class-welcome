Unlike the [AMC Classroom](http://classroom.thoughtram.io/#/class/angular2-master-class), this repo is not hosted on Github pages. To serve these slides, simply web host the `index.html` page from the repo root.


```console
live-server
```


#### Demo JumpStart

When you arrive to the Demo slide (~page 8), you can show a live demonstration of the final (1st day), jump start solution. In your local [AMC Solutions](https://github.com/thoughtram/angular2-master-class-solutions) repo, check out the **jump-start-step-13** and run the application:

```console
git co jump-start-step-13
ng serve
```

In another terminal, run the REST-API server for the **Contacts** dataservice calls

```console
npm run rest-api
``` 

Then view the application at http://localhost:4200
